The blurry background is a cute anime styled character of bladee, he is pale, has dark brown hair with a tint of red, big blue eyes, pointed ears, a white collared shirt, and is holding up his hands in the shape of a 'w', but his hands are not quite touching. The sky and water behind him is very blue."
